irontemplate
============

This project is a template project for [ifmapj-based][ifmapj] clients.
It provides everything to get started with developing clients, and can be used as the
basis for your own client.

The file **HOWTO.md** describes, which files have to be adjusted for your own IF-MAP
Client.

This template was created by the [Trust@HsH research group][trustathsh]
at the [Hochschule Hannover][hshannover] (University of Applied Sciences and Arts,
Hannover, Germany).

If you have any questions about this project or developing with ifmapj in general, feel
